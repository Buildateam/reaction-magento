# Reaction Commerce Magento importer

This package is used to import data from Magento EE 1.x stores into Reaction Commerce.

The package can be used to import products, orders and customers. 

Products and orders are imported via Magento API and customers using a csv file from standard Magento export functionality.

The package needs more work and might require customizations for each particular scenario.
